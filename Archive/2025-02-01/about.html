      My name is Robert Phares. I am a hobby web developer. I have been
      developing software on and off for almost 10 years. I have a degree in
      Electrical Engineering but do not work in the field. I am currently
      working as a Tax Associate at a tax preperation company. Some extra
      curricular activities I enjoy are pickleball, comic books, and video
      games.
